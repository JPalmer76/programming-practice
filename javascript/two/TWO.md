# Module TWO
Module two will start to get into more advanced concepts in JavaScript. Mainly, we will be introducing Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and how they are implemented in JS. We will also talk about advanced list operations and maps. After this module, JavaScript should be second nature to you and you should feel confident in tackling any problem with vanilla JavaScript.
