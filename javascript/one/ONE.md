# Module ONE
Module one is dedicated to the very basics of problem solving with JavaScript. There is an assumption of a very basic understanding of JavaScript syntax (decalring variables, the console.log function, etc)

The order in which to go through the modules is as follows:
1. conditional execution
2. repeated execution
3. switch cases
4. lists and strings
