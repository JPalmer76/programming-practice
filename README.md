# Programming Practice
This is a project dedicated to helping people learn to program by providing a structured approach.

Each folder is centered around learning a specific language.

The intent is to provide problems of increasing difficulty that rely on slightly more understanding and problem solving skill than the last. Don't worry, though, the exercises will be well commented and introduce you to the ideas before you need to apply them. Eventually I would like each excercise to be preceeded by a lesson outlining the concepts of the following exercises.

If you notice any bugs inside this project, please submit an issue. If you know how to fix it, feel free to fork the repository, fix the problem, and open a pull request.
