# Programming Practice
This is a project dedicated to helping people learn to program by providing a structured approach.

Each folder is centered around learning a specific language.

The intent is to provide problems of increasing difficulty that rely on slightly more understanding and problem solving skill than the last. Don't worry, though, the exercises will be well commented and introduce you to the ideas before you need to apply them. Eventually I would like each excercise to be preceeded by a lesson outlining the concepts of the following exercises.

If you notice any bugs inside this project, please submit an issue. If you know how to fix it, feel free to fork the repository, fix the problem, and open a pull request. If you wish to start a directory for a language not included, please feel free to do so, and make sure to implement all of the lessons/exercises we have at that current time.

One last note is to follow the instructions exactly. This is important in that each exercise and lesson grows on the previous. Don't overshoot or get to antsy to write something complicated. You will get there, just think simply and directly based on the problem you are given. You will move faster through this course and be more confident in solving problems correctly a lot quicker.

Happy programming!
